### src\grains\3_stochastic_gs.ipynb
- Extracted slice indexes from "corpus\metro_sample_2\input.wav" 
- Computing chroma_cqts (Constant-Q Transform) for each grain, to extract the chromatic note of each grain
- Implemented asynchronous granular synthesis with randomized parametre selection
- Implemented granular synthesis with logistic map for grain start position selection: this algorithms also includes some stochastic grain parameterization

### src\grains\2_grain_analysis.ipynb
- Clustered predetermined grains based on all descriptors in grains.json
- Linear interpolation from a given starting point to and end point in the descriptor space is used to compute the n nearest neighbours along this trajectory. These are concatenated into an output audio array
